Here is a set of scripts that simplify work with Cloudera docker container image.

======
Description
======

Below is description of what each script does:

**create** - creates docker container with Cloudera QuickStart image inside.
It maps several ports from docker instance to the host machine for make it
possible to interact with different Cloudera components through Web interface.

NOTE: it maps **/root/cloudera_docker/share** directory to the docker image
instance. You can use it for sharing data between docker machine and host machine.

**remove** - destroys existing docker instance.

**list** - shows all the existing docker images with their status.

**start** - actually runs the existing docker instance. More likely you
would call it after **create**.

**pause** - pause started instance.

**login** - get shell of the started container.

======
Workflow
======

1. Create new Cloudera QuickStart docker instance with given name using **create** script.
You can use name that corresponds your's laboratory work number.

2. Start the instance using **start** script. Check **list** output: now you should see
the entry with yours image name and status "Up". Please check that all the port mappings
are exist.

3. You can now login into the shell of the running instance using **login** script
   OR
   You can access Apache Hue Web UI through firefox by requesting URL "localhost:8888" by default.

4. You can use "/root/cloudera_docker/share" directory to share data between host image
and your docker instance.

NOTE 1: when one instance is already in "Up" state in the **list** output, it is NOT POSSIBLE
to run another instance with the same port mapping as the running one. Now the only workaround
is to "pause" the running container (using **pause** script) before starting the new one.

NOTE 2: if you are trying to access the Web UI through some X11 application (e.g. firefox) run
it from non-root user.
